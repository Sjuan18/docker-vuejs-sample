## Introduction

Vue.js is a progressive JavaScript framework used for building user interfaces. By combining Vue.js with Docker, developers can create isolated environments that ensure consistent application behavior across different stages of development and production. This repository demonstrates how to set up a Dockerized Vue.js application efficiently.

## Features

- **Production-Ready**: This setup is designed for real-world applications.
- **Developer-Centric**: Streamlined for developers with clear documentation.
- **High Performance**: Optimized for speed and efficiency.
- **Scalable**: Easily adapt to growing application needs.
- **Secure**: Implements best practices for security.
- **CI/CD Integration**: Seamlessly integrate with continuous integration and deployment workflows.

## Getting Started

To get started with this repository, you need to have Docker and Docker Compose installed on your machine. If you haven't installed them yet, follow the official installation guides:

- [Docker Installation](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)
- [Docker Compose Installation](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)

Once you have Docker and Docker Compose set up, you can clone this repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Sjuan18/docker-vuejs-sample.git
cd docker-vuejs-sample
```

You can find the latest releases of this project [here](https://github.com/Sjuan18/docker-vuejs-sample/releases). Download the appropriate version and follow the instructions provided in the release notes.

## Usage

After cloning the repository, you can start the application using Docker Compose. Run the following command in the terminal:

```bash
docker-compose up
```

This command will build the Docker images and start the containers defined in the `docker-compose.yml` file. Your Vue.js application should now be running on `http://localhost:8080`.

### Environment Variables

You can customize the application using environment variables. Create a `.env` file in the root directory and define your variables there. The sample `.env` file is provided as `.env.example`.

## Project Structure

The project structure is organized as follows:

```
docker-vuejs-sample/
â”‚
â”œâ”€â”€ docker-compose.yml      # Docker Compose configuration
â”œâ”€â”€ Dockerfile              # Dockerfile for building the Vue.js app
â”œâ”€â”€ .env.example            # Sample environment variables
â”œâ”€â”€ src/                   # Source files for the Vue.js application
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ components/        # Vue components
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ views/             # Application views
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ App.vue            # Main application component
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ main.js            # Entry point of the application
â””â”€â”€ public/                # Static files
```

## Deployment

For deployment, you can build the production-ready Docker image using the following command:

```bash
docker build -t your-image-name .
```

Once built, you can run the image:

```bash
docker run -p 8080:80 your-image-name
```

Your application will be accessible at `http://localhost:8080`.

### CI/CD Integration

This repository supports CI/CD workflows. You can set up your CI/CD pipelines to automate testing and deployment. Popular CI/CD tools like GitHub Actions, Travis CI, and Jenkins can easily integrate with this setup.

Refer to the documentation of your chosen CI/CD tool for specific instructions on how to configure it with this repository.
